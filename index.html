I&#39;ve wanted to work on automated building for some time now. My experience seems to be align pretty nicely with what Branch is doing. I&#39;ve practiced robotics and I have worked on traingulation algorithms for data visualization. Please consider letting me work with you so I can build on the work you have done.</h3>

<h2 id="-home-lab">  Home Lab</h2>
<p>  My workbench at home is surrounded by my collection of electrical components, which I use whenever an idea strikes my mind.
  Said components go into building things like a tiny robot arm, or a flute on a breadboard.
  I program microcontrollers as part of my tinkering.
  I like to use my 3d printer to make doodads. I usually download models to print directly; though sometimes I modify with 3d design software them before printing.
  I try out new linux OS&#39;s from time to time.
  I enjoy programing <a href="computercraft.info">Minecraft robots</a> to build structures.
  I like to tinker away at my own software projects.
  Here are a few projects I&#39;ve messed with recently:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="github.com/bddap/haskell-synth">haskell-synth</a> is a library written that transforms a function into a series of audio samples.
The idea is that I should be able to define a nice song as a function of time.</li>
<li><a href="github.com/bddap/space-game">space-game</a> is a never ending project I use to learn 3D graphics and orbital mechanics.
Space game has seen three spend-weeks-on-nothing-but-programming-and-forget-to-eat-meals iterations.</li>
<li><a href="github.com/bddap/auto-gui">auto-gui</a> was something I coded up last week.
It takes a configuration file then displays it as a gui. After the user has had their fun, it returns the modified configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-clive-coffee-september-2011-to-jan-2013">  Clive Coffee, September 2011 to Jan 2013</h2>
<p>  Worked seasonally at <a href="clivecoffee.com">Clive Coffee</a> in Portland, Oregon.
  Performed a few jobs there. First packing and shipping, then IT.
  IT work involved maintenance on the order management system at Clive Coffee.
  Installed applications and performed general IT tasks (so mostly installing printer drivers).
  Performed fresh OS installs with Windows. I can do the same with mac and linux too.</p>
<h2 id="-construction">  Construction</h2>
<p>  Spent a summer using a chainsaw to convert nearby trees into a picnic shelter for a youth hostel.</p>
<h2 id="-keyssa-may-2014-to-present">  Keyssa, May 2014 to present</h2>
<p>  At <a href="keyssa.com">Keyssa</a>, I program a neat eight DOF <a href="http://www.robai.com/">robotic arm</a> to take measurements.
  I actively develop the arm&#39;s software as users come up with new requirements.
  I automate scientific tests regularly.
  I am familiar with physical test automation standards like SCPI.
  I read and use documentation regularly.
  I programmatically communicate with numerous pieces of special purpose equipment to build automated tests.
  Data visualization: automated tests gather large data sets which I happily render as graphs.
  While some visualizations are simple (Just a scatter plot), some require fancy interactive 3d renderings.</p>
